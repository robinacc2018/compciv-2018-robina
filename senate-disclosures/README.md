My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at the annual inocome of senators by state and compare it to the average household income of the state they represent.  The visualization idea is to show the comparision of senators annual income as a percentage of median household income network projected onto a map of the United States.

How much are California's members of congress worth? - http://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/political-notebook/article203579219.html

"The Valley sends several millionaires to Washington, but it also includes the perennial "poorest member of Congress" in Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford, who lists millions in liabilities due to credit lines used to purchase equipment for his family's dairy operation.

Valadao's financial disclosure forms showed stakes in Valadao Dairy and Triple V Dairy worth at least $1 million each, but he also listed at least $19.5 million – mostly from Rabobank credit lines – in liabilities."

"The total wealth of all current members was at least $2.43 billion when the 115th Congress began, 20 percent more than the collective riches of the previous Congress, a significant gain during a period when both the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose slightly less than 10 percent.""

"There are 20 millionaires in Congress from California, an analysis of the data finds. Their fortunes come from real estate holdings, tech stocks, investment portfolios and their spouses. Lawmakers are not required to disclose property they own unless it is earning income, and they also do not need to list their $174,000 annual salaries, putting each and every one of them above the average Californian."

"In 2015, three Senate Republicans at least doubled their wealth in a single calendar year.

The list includes Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota (up 490 percent); Roger Wicker of Mississippi (326 percent); and Thad Cochran of Mississippi (124 percent); according the personal financial disclosures filed with the Senate.

Rounds was worth an estimated $2.7 million in 2014 and $16.2 million a year later, mostly due to his wife selling her real estate and insurance company. Wicker sold his stake in his timber company. Cochran remarried into wealth.

When members of Congress file their annual personal financial reports, they’re allowed to list the value of their assets and liabilities in broad ranges. In practical terms, that obscures exactly how much each member of Congress is worth. And the larger the value of the asset, the broader the allowable range.

To account for those ranges, CRP’s researchers establish a minimum and maximum net worth, and then use the average as an estimated net worth for each member of Congress."


Historical Understanding of Disclosures - https://www.opensecrets.org/pfds../methodology.php

"Filers are required to include much of the same information about their spouses that they must disclose about their own finances and activities, though often less specificity is allowed. Assets, liabilities, income, transactions, gifts, and travel reimbursements of spouses and dependent children are included in these disclosures and, therefore, are used in our industry and net worth calculations. Some filers attach account statements or other additional material as a supplement or replacement for the standard forms. When new or more detailed information was available in these attachments, it was entered as well."
