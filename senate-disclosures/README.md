# Final project readme


My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at the network of senetors by state and compare it to the average household income of the state.  The visualization idea is to show the comparision of senators income as a percentage of median house hold income projected onto a map of the United States.

"The Valley sends several millionaires to Washington, but it also includes the perennial "poorest member of Congress" in Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford, who lists millions in liabilities due to credit lines used to purchase equipment for his family's dairy operation.

Valadao's financial disclosure forms showed stakes in Valadao Dairy and Triple V Dairy worth at least $1 million each, but he also listed at least $19.5 million – mostly from Rabobank credit lines – in liabilities."

"The total wealth of all current members was at least $2.43 billion when the 115th Congress began, 20 percent more than the collective riches of the previous Congress, a significant gain during a period when both the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose slightly less than 10 percent.""

"There are 20 millionaires in Congress from California, an analysis of the data finds. Their fortunes come from real estate holdings, tech stocks, investment portfolios and their spouses. Lawmakers are not required to disclose property they own unless it is earning income, and they also do not need to list their $174,000 annual salaries, putting each and every one of them above the average Californian."
